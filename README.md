## Add visible email address to a profile box

1. Go to: https://muohio.libapps.com/libapps/accounts.php
2. Click on the gear icon for an individual user (right side of their entry)
3. Click on the "profile box" tab on their page
4. Code from the `email-link-widget.js` file should be placed in the "other widget code" section inside a `<script></script>` tag.

### Known Bug!

This apparently works poorly on pages with two profile boxes, eg:

- https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/infotech
- https://libguides.lib.miamioh.edu/psychological_science
